# Settlers 4 remake (File Formats)
This is a Settlers 4 (Siedler 4) Remake (it will be :-) ) written in JavaScript (Typescript) so 
  it can be run in your browser.
  
<p style="text-align:center" align="center">
<a href="https://settlers.hmilch.net/">🎉 run the "game" 🎉</a>
</p>


# How to compile:
1. Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/)
2. run on command line:

        npm install
        npm run build


➜ This will create the `./dist/` folder with the app.


# How to start:
You need a WebServer that serves the App. E.g. you can use the included one:
1. Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Copy the *Settlers-4*-game folder with the files (`game.lib`, `gfx.lib`, `Gfx/0.gfx`, ...) to the `/dist/` folder - e.g. to `./dist/Siedler4/`
3. Run `./dist/run.bat` \
   This will: 
   * create a list of all files in your e.g. `./dist/Siedler4/` folder.
   * start a local Webserver on your PC
4. Open: http://localhost:8888/


# How to edit:
You can use *Visual Studio Code* to edit and debug your code:
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install *Debugger for Chrome* Plugin in Visual Studio Code
3. Copy the *Settlers-4*-game folder to `./public/` e.g.  to `./public/Siedler4/`
4. run

        npm install
        npm run serve

    Or press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to start the live-server in VS-Code

    ➜ This will start a live-server on http://localhost:8080/


* Fix code style / linter errors

        npm run lint -- --fix


* Run unit tests

        npm run test:unit

or to run a single file in watch mode:

        npm run test:watch tests/unit/objects-info.spec.ts


# Next BIG steps:
1. using webGl to render the state of a game by loading a save game and pushing all data to webGl:
    - ✔️ drawing map background
    - ⌛ drawing objects
    - drawing settlers
    - drawing buildings

2. adding game logic to process state changing in the game
    - see: `game.lib/objectInfo.xml` and `game.lib/buildingInfo.xml`
    - see: https://github.com/jsettlers/settlers-remake


3. adding backend logic
     - use MQTT over websocket to connect with other players see: http://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/


# State:
